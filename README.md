# ProductManagementSpring

## Overview
This project is a **Product Management System** built using the Spring Framework. It demonstrates key functionalities such as CRUD operations for products, category management, user authentication, and role-based access control. The system is designed with scalability, security, and performance optimization in mind.

## Features
- **Domain Modeling**
  - Designed entities such as `Product`, `Category`, `User`, and `Order` using JPA.
  - Created repositories (`ProductRepository`, `CategoryRepository`) for efficient data access.

- **Service Layer**
  - Implemented core business logic in service classes like `ProductService` and `CategoryService`.
  - Managed transactions to ensure data consistency using `@Transactional`.

- **REST API Development**
  - Exposed product management functionalities via RESTful endpoints using Spring MVC.
  - Handled request/response validation using DTOs and annotations like `@Valid` and `@RequestBody`.

- **Security Implementation**
  - Integrated Spring Security to secure the application with role-based access control.
  - Implemented token-based authentication using OAuth2/JWT.

- **Database & Caching**
  - Configured database interaction using Spring Data JPA with support for MySQL/PostgreSQL.
  - Enhanced performance with caching strategies using Spring Cache.

- **Testing**
  - Performed unit testing using JUnit and Mockito.
  - Conducted integration testing to validate end-to-end functionality.

- **Deployment & Scalability**
  - Set up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins/GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment.
  - Explored microservices architecture using Spring Cloud for scalable deployments.

- **Monitoring & Maintenance**
  - Implemented logging with Logback/Log4j for tracking application behavior.
  - Monitored application performance using Prometheus and Grafana.
